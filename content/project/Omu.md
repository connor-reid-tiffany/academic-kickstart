# Omu

Omu is an R package for analyzing metabolomics data sets. It assigns classes to metabolites using KEGG compound numbers, can perform students T tests and anovas, create publication ready figures that intuitively abstract the data, and can assign pathway, gene, and organism meta data to metabolites via the KEGG API (using wrappers for keggGet from the R package KEGGREST).
